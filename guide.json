little bit of this never hurts a little me okay yeah I just snack on these pink things and whoo-hoo watch out for that guy and depending on the area you can find a lot of these pink things okay be careful but then hmm watch out then I moved on to these little ooh that guy's dead - the little purple guys where's the purple guys okay here they are I like to call these guys bug-eyed McGee look at those cute bug eyes so I just work on these guys for a little bit we're already at level three okay you just work on these guys a little bit you can level up pretty fast they're kind of hard to catch once you get um they're dead get over here bug eyes McGee oh they're so cute these out of all the fish these might be the cutest most of all most of what all they are is just eyeballs and so I left love with these guys I get to maybe level four maybe level five and then I move on to the Jackpine spot okay so now that I'm at level five it's time to move on to the jackpot spot so here it is now the thing about the jackpot I like to call is the jackpot spot think about the jackpot spot is a lot of the other fish knows the jackpots by two um so it could get dangerous but right now dude if you're clear if there's no I think they're called like pleasure sub that there's no pledge right they you're good to go mad so you just you just hang out here you chomp a bunch of these fish and you level up and it's beautiful because there's no other fish like stealing your meat and these fish don't even eat it I don't know why like every fish if there's meat laying around they all grab it but these fish they don't grab the meat they just sit here they're not hostile it's like it's a jackpot spot but the thing is they just keep spawning in it just keeps spawning it there's no hostile fish around these just keep spawning in that you'll never run out and you just are chomping okay so now we're at level 11 at this point you don't even have to aim for the fish you just start chopping and they just run into you just hitting the left click button I'm just hitting left like now I'm just moving around so I'm just facing them and you just keep chomping and then you end up breaking the meet up and I found out I'm pretty sure if you break up the meet you end up getting more XP so you just keep chopping the fish we're getting a lot of meat here dude holy yeah and then you just suck it all up we went from 11 to 12 to 13 now we're at 14 it's just the fastest way I've ever seen to get coins to level up and I know it's kind of like an exploit kind of thing because they just keep respawn but if you want to just get some quick coins you want to just level up really quick it's the fastest way to do it dude we're level 16 already and then eventually just get big enough to where you can just suck up the fish automatically I'm just holding right-click they keep spawning I just select them in the thing is though you get plenty of coins this way with every fish that you just in golf but you get more point to get more points to level up if you chop up the meat like this okay holy camp we're level 24 this is crazy okay okay so I just had to show you guys I just had to show you something I found out and that's how I ended up with so many coins hey I wonder where little 20 40 think when you take on a catfish let's go for let's go for the campus okay we're doing 38 damage he's doing 21 damage we got this guy catfish is dead baby oh holy crap okay let's break up the meat hopefully no other fish come and break and steal army holy crap holy crap that's a lot that's a lot of meat okay so let's just take it all in holy crap holy crap okay so guys let's switch fish let's do the catfish because last Part we were messing with catfish a lot and I never use the catfish so let's switch over to the catfish let's have some fun with him so in the beta map we can use the buy boats or Bevo's whatever you want to call it the Raptor the klej and the catfish catfish is 50 coins huh we only have 863 okay here we go let's have some fun with the catfish so guys I saw in the comments some people are talking about how you say the name of this game some people call it fish feed and grow some people call it theme grow fish it's tough because in steam it's called feed and grow fish but Oh Oh tonight Li is this leftover from me but in the title screen it looks like it has it as fish feed and grow be the way you can call it whatever you want I just love it I just love the game okay let's eat some crab dude I actually love crab legs do you guys like crab legs I know some people aren't like big into seafood I personally really like it I'm like a really picky eater but I really like seafood Oh be out of Bibles or Bebo's he's trying to tag me try to take me down you can't take down a cabbage do the knight whole was the oh that's a Raptor guys I want to be a raptor today I want to be a raptor and I want to get huge okay so we leveled up is the café's we're taking these guys down whole one nice thing about the catfish is you don't really have to get that big you can just swallow these bug I McGee's you can swallow them whole pretty quickly right off the bat we're only level two okay so I won't do the exploit let's look for some let's look for some prey where's that klej oh there's one get him dude he did even see me coming oh we got him dude oh oh Judy's friends are his friends are eating the remains okay dude back off okay dude with some of these fish some of them will they'll like team up against you that's when it gets really dangerous these guys aren't even doing anything they know they're no match okay we got three of them we got three klej so that could be could be dangerous dude I don't know man they're not doing anything it's me my catfish buddy we're just bullying these guys oh okay dude I see a by Bo's I see I see a BIOS and a clutch this could get ugly your the thing is when you're a big fish you're always a risk of getting like teamed up Bob okay dude I see a few Raptors to get him yes it's all about time and baby I see some Raptors now the fact that I attacked one of them it could make some of the other ones come around dude I don't know man I think we're pretty safe I feel like of all the maps I think the beta map oh here we go we got by boat okay we got a pack of I bows and they're going to get the rafter okay no don't die here don't die here okay don't die here okay cuz I was just about to say I think of all the vamps I feel like the beta map might be the easiest it's not too big there aren't really a lot of predators you just got like four different fish so I feel like it's the easiest okay we got we have five Bibles okay we got five votes I want to take them out I want to take about can I take these guys out dude okay my health is at 194 183 mmm okay so what I what I try to do is just spring out of this when they're doing that oh man 136 dude Oh baby I love how I just said this is the easiest of our bout to die okay okay go through here sound good hmm know what Dad hey we're dead what can you do at this point I can't turn around to get these guys okay dude a Pecha by Bose that's a tough one all right all right well that's enough of a beta map let's go dude let's go to the ocean how I I've never killed a great white shark I don't know today's the day I'm gonna try so we're gonna do normal we're gonna do deathmatch unlimited cuz I gotta get like I don't know what level I gotta be but I gotta be a high level to take out that great white okay so guys like I said I want to be a raptor and I want to make it huge there's also the tio taka the nil and the drew eel The Clash the trade the tiger shark the brow rag I'm gonna be all of these eventually but today I don't know why I'm feeling like the Raptor I feel like he just looks so cool I feel like he would just look amazing if you were huge so his damage is already better than the buy bows and he has this passive ambush so your velocity is converted into boys damnit so the faster you go the more damage you deal which is great cuz I'm always sprinting when I'm attacking so hopefully we do okay and I think I think the ocean is by far the most difficult level you got the brow rag you get the tiger shark you got the great white shark you know there's just so many things that could take you out here we save think we're safe where am I am i oh okay all right now the ocean it's a pretty a pretty big map too okay when I first start out what's going on over there I'm trying to see what's going on from a distance when I first started out I like to pull yes yes this is a good start this is a good start oh okay get out of here I like to go to the crabs I like to have fun with the crabs and I feel like that's a great way to level up at the start here okay these fish are passive we have some other guys okay let's just look for our crab friends hmm okay watch off the dragon it's a we gotta find our crap oho there's a tiger shark we gotta find our crab friends I think a crab friends are over here yeah baby Oh No well that's great white shark no we had the same idea okay okay um great white shark had the same idea is us um let's see if I could grab one of these guys yeah here we go dude first hit with seven damaged that's really good seven damage for the first hit and it wants to just bend cuz I was sprinting towards them okay so are you level two not bad we have to wait for that great white shark to get out of here oh I found a crab I found a stray crab okay this is good start dudes the crabs they're like the easiest they barely even fight back I think sometimes they fight back but for the oh no oh no oh dude I was stuck that was weird that was weird I think I got stuck in the wall or stop them okay you had two crabs touches you're just fun to kill they're also like really funny like it - okay so great whites still here okay I think I think the great white left okay so let's slowly make our way over there we'll grab some of these stray crabs okay are they gonna write again a gang up on me no he's not even open his friend just let me take about okay do we have a lot of crabs here hmm I do have to remember to sprint as I'm going in for the kill because we do a lot of damage when we sprint okay leveled up we're level three baby okay do you see any great white I don't see any great white I think we're safe all right let's see how much damage I do okay nine I think I hit the ground first I want to see how much damage I can do if I get a good sprint a good like running startup to one of these guys Oh 13 Oh so yeah if you get some good velocity Wow 13 damage that's not bad oh I didn't even see that there's an ambush meter okay so it looks like the ambush meter is in direct relation to our speed so yeah once we hit top speed the ambush meters all the way up so that's really cool okay now we're at level six let's see how much damage I do okay eighteen that's pretty good it's not bad okay we have a lot of crabs we got to be careful okay yeah the crabs are actually fighting back now so we got to be a little careful Oh fighting these crabs because they will gang up on me and there's a lot of them down here dude they're like teaming up okay I'm backing off let's sprint and get this guy we're level eight holy crap one chunk twenty-nine damage dude that is really good you ever just wonder what some of these fish are doing like these guys what are you doing like they're swimming around yeah this one around but like what are you trying to accomplish what are you doing you just swimming let's just follow them for a little bit okay so guys just hanging on that corner now they're swimming over here okay now they're swimming into the seaweed yeah they're doing nothing absolutely nothing you know by eating these fish I'm kind of doing them a favor they got nothing else going on you know why not just get eaten by a big old Raptor all right so we're level 10 now I should be able to take on some bigger fish now but what do we want to take on there's no way I could get even close to a brow rag or tiger shark or anything okay I think I see some eel here they take out some eel and dude there's some free food up here okay towards the surface there's some nice things going on up here okay I don't know if the eel traveling packs okay this eel is going straight towards that brow rag what is he doing okay okay he's going straight towards that brow rag I'm not interested in that okay I don't know I was trimming swing straight towards him yeah let's mess with some eel oh they don't seem very smart okay so these are like the dragon fish um I don't think these guys are like pack hunters so if I attack one of them I don't think they're all gonna go after me so let's mess with these guys a little that t/o taka those little blue teo tacos I actually don't want to mess with those they might attack me I don't know I'm level 15 they shouldn't but I don't mind taking these guys the dragon fish oh no okay okay so I did just attack @eo taka Oh No do Tai Chi get off of me get off of me oh man okay the deal doc I'm bad you don't want to mess with those guys and I kind of just picked a fight with them it's not good oh my goodness dude yeah I think this is called the Dre the dragon kind of look at fish okay yeah okay okay I think I could just feed on these guys for a little while I don't know cuz I think these guys keep spawning as well okay yeah we're level 16 dude this might be our new jackpot spot this might be our ocean jackpot spot and the other guys they're not like protecting up it's perfect it's perfect okay chomp this up a little more chomp it up to get more meat yes oh no dude we're in trouble okay dude the tío tacos are attacking no no no no stop it I need some trade to help me okay get out of here oh man dude how do we get out of that okay the tio tags were we got our health back do let's go over here man don't stick it tio taco they don't let up they're dangerous holy crap okay yeah let's let them just hang out there I love these guys I love this with these guys they don't fight back holy cow it's like a war over there with the drape in the tea Oh tacos holy crap it's an absolute war okay let's see how much damage we're doing 78 damage with a sprint holy crap that's a lot of damage okay dude we are sitting pretty as long as we don't get attacked by those tio tacos I think we'll be good okay we are in a little bit of danger there's a tiger shark oh there's two tiger sharks down there no no the tiger sharks no the tiger sharks look a bit okay so hopefully hopefully they don't mess with me over here oh man okay tiger sharks just just stay away keep your distance man always right there I can't believe okay we're almost at level 20 I've never been at level 20 in the ocean hopefully we can do it dude yeah those sharks oh no the sharks are coming in no the Sharks are butting in on my feeding spot okay let's grab some of this free food let's get out of here we're almost at level 20 I just gotta make it out of here safe man okay we just hit level 20 okay this is good oh we got one of these guys I think this is AK ledge he's like hiding in the corner you can't hide man okay I want to check out our jackpot spot again let's see if those tiger sharks are still there man oh my goodness dude okay I don't know I don't see any sharks I think we might be in the clear this is definitely a dangerous oh there's a bunch of tea Oh taco it's definitely a dangerous area why dude if there's not a bunch of dudes a car a bunch of sharks this is a really good way to level up all right guys look at this so if we sprint we're doing 157 damage if we sprint now if I remember correctly I think the great white shark does 84 damage so that's almost double the damage but the thing is the hits after it they aren't 158 you know okay so it looks like 51 is our base damage level 30 we gotta be pretty close being able to take on at least a tiger shark if not the brow rag or a great white okay guys we're level 38 our base damage is 83 I think we could take on some pig so good guys so let's see if I can find a tiger shark let's see if I can find a brow rag and a great white I want to take them all on holy crap Rhett level 40 dude okay give me uh give me a tiger shark I think there was tiger shark hanging around around here somewhere okay there's a brow rag there's the great white dude I don't want to hit I don't want to mess with a great great white yet dude I'm nervous I've never been to level 40 this is awesome I just want to mess it up and I gotta be careful those bibo sortie Oh tiger they could take me out quick okay so I see some tiger sharks oh I couldn't take out multiple tiger sharks okay maybe we're gonna go for the brown rag or we gonna go for a pro wreck I'm gonna do it I'm gonna do it I'm gonna go for a brown rag oh no dude that products messing with five volts no no and dude my health is over five hundred that's crazy okay here's a tiger shark okay we got multiple tiger sharks oh no oh I did it I did it I took the tiger shark out one bite holy crap okay next up

crap oh whoa we're taking these guys out fast okay oh it's a tiger shark your tiger shark one bite for level 42 baby okay I think we'd take out the great white listen still let's just keep going dude the brown eggs going up against a tiger shark okay I could get out on this okay let's get 312 312 with our first hit cuz the ambush that's insane okay hit the tiger shark dude things are things are really heating up around here the tiger sharks aren't even messing with me oh no oh this tiger shark is who I gotta get turned on oh good turn on you play as a tiger shark oh my goodness level 44 oh dude I got a little nervous I got a little nervous that tiger shark he was doing something okay there's the great white do we go for him we go for I think I think we're gonna go for him hey dude he's like he's like up out of the water or something oh he's attacking a brow rag okay I'll let him finish his meal I'll let him finish that meal oh man we're gonna do this we're going up against a great white oh oh he almost got me dude that was close okay I gotta get the first bite in on him okay okay get him get him get the first bite 161 damage 123 oh no I wasn't fast enough I was going fast up we

white around we got a brow rag is it what's he doing you know yeah let's mess with another brown rag 366 damaged in our help is in the 700 holy crap obviously guys after a while it starts to get

doing crab madness now guys I've never done this game-mode before so it should be a lot of fun but really quick before we get into it last Part got 5,000 likes are you kidding me guys you keep pulling me away thank you so much I can't thank you guys enough for your support like I said before it just shows me that you guys want to see more of this so thank you thank you thank you guys we're going into some crab madness so the goal with crab madness I think we can only play on the ocean yes this requires normal in the ocean map so I think the goal here is to become the king crab I think you have to get to level 10 I'm actually not sure we're about to find out guys like I said I've never done this before fish select okay well crab isn't really a fish is it okay here we go crab and this is lack so that's the king crab requires a demon king crab grow up crab to level 10 so that's what we got to do so his health is at 90 damage - okay what are we at 17 damage is to still well that's kind of crazy the king crab has the same damage well it's so she has more help okay here we go now we don't have any abilities that kind of stinks the crab is really cute oh look at those huge eyes guys this is it this is our first crab madness and I think actually in the recent update last Part I did a Part on the update they update a lot of stuff and I dig they added the ability to jump how do you jump oh you hit you hit shift to jump okay just normally sprint oh wow so it's like a sprint jump that's crazy Oh what is that then Oh Brower I get a tiger shark okay hopefully they leave me alone guys I'm like I said I've never been a crab so I don't really know I really don't know what to expect if this is gonna be if like the big fish are gonna be like attacking me a lot or for what okay am I I think I'm inside this this ship this sunken ship or something okay and I think they added like a sidestep oh that is awesome I love this slide step oh oh - that scared me I heard something coming Kathy was a friend yeah that's more of a Krabs movement anyways I feel like crabs move sideways a lot I don't know we have expert patches oh oh these usually give a lot okay that gave something did it give me a coin that's cool dude we are in the middle of this sunken ship look at that it's like a treasure chest no guys I think there's another king crab I have no idea where he is I don't really know where I am to be honest I don't know where the king the other king crab is but we're gonna have to look out for him because I think he has like minions and stuff okay let's go up here I feel like we're like really deep down so let's go up a little bit that's nice it only takes one hit to break these up I do oh we got a lot of these I do miss the days where we could just suck these up and then after break oh but it's not too bad oh is it a goldfish down there do I think I see you go boom I see the shadow of a big fish get out of here okay okay watch out all right that goldfish is gone what is that oh that looks like a trait the dragon fish he's not like coming after me is he no he's not coming after me it looks like looks like with us being it whoa no that trait this coming after me get out of here no no no no dude I can't get out of here oh okay okay okay okay grab man this is hard okay well we're back with our buddies we got to level three thanks goal beat level three oh this is a good area oh I'm familiar with this area I think dude what's that there's a tea Otaka okay yeah I'm familiar with this area this is usually always think I see a goldfish this is usually where I'm snacking on the other crabs and yeah this isn't a bad area I think this is safe for the most part sometimes sometimes the tiger sharks will it will come in here I see an octopus but dude we didn't stand a chance against that drave I just thought you know with us beating the bottom maybe maybe the other fish just would leave us alone but they're not gonna do that you know another difficult you so cute Oh our friends upside down let's help our friend itself em ah there you go buddy dude we are oh look at all those hey get back your goldfish dude can I get two no he's too fast guys oh this is gonna be a big problem because normally I can just sprint normally I can just sprint to get away from enemies and stuff ok he'll break it I'll tell you there we go you break it I take it that seems fair oh no another great get off get off me get off me ok hmm he was gonna leave me alone not another drave ok what I was trying to say was that normally we can sprint to get away from enemies but now if I hit sprint I just jump that's not a good way to get away from enemies well we got to level 3 again because we gotta get to level 4 there's that stupid drape bully jerk up there oh he's coming back he's coming back ok ok um jumping get this ok no need to jump is he still coming after me yeah the trait that's still coming after me why why oh there's a green crab ok I don't know if the green crab would attack me okay let's just let's steer clear of them here's my new strategy if I see any fish that could take me down just run just run as soon as I see any I'm gonna try to keep like a 5 mile radius between me and any fish that could take me down Oh cheap and unlocked giant crab Jake can't grow crab to level 5 okay so I got him to level 5 we're halfway there ok that's good I just took out one of those green ones so that proves that the green ones are bad Oh No oh dude it's a tiger shark did you see that tiger shark coming right for us luckily he changed his mind guys we're not in a good area Oh tiger shark right above me take a shark right above me oh man who's - tiger sharks right there ok I may have figured something out I don't know if this is good strategy or not but I found that when you hit shift while you're going forward if you if you point down it's almost like sprinting because if you hit shift while looking forward you jump I don't know I don't know if that's a good strategy a lot of times I don't want to jump so if I'm looking down it's kind of like sprinting forward ok guys I don't know if this is a good idea I'm gonna go after this green guy oh yeah he's small yeah baby so now we could take out the green crabs I think this is gonna be good Oh guys look down there there's the king crab he's gonna scepter receptors glowing ok holy crab that's a lot of crabs did you say oh I think I just said holy crab so that's where we don't want to go ok I do want to get these though we just got to make sure not to fall down there guys the king crab is down there holy crab once I become king crab I'm gonna just throw on that guy oh can I give this guy yes I got him dude the fish are tough to get man cuz you can't really swim you can't swim as a crab yeah we're level eight guys two more levels robos there oh I'm actually big enough to just suck these up now that's nice I don't have to break them up okay I want to scope this area out this area can be good sometimes okay what do we got we just got some of those little fish I think we're safe I think we're safe to go on the prowl for some of these guys okay can I do an aerial attack oh there's a there's a green crab oh my get this guy the green crabs yeah easy man an aerial attack would have been nice but do we get up on the ground guys this one should get us to level 9 we're almost there dude like I think my strategy is working of just staying as staying as far away from the other fish as possible level 9 okay and we gotta keep her eye view oh look at this guy just coming right to me oh no oh no boom okay that's not good that's a raptor okay we gotta get out of here guys it's time to bail time to bail we don't want to mess with Raptors cuz Raptors dude they travel in packs Oh give me that goldfish give me that goldfish dude you're just sitting there okay guys we are so stinking close oh no tiger shark no I'm almost there no we gotta get out of here no is there a way to get away from him no he's doing seven damage came out of nowhere guys we were a level nine and a half we were there oh man dude tiger shark out of nowhere guys I'm freaking out where ever a level nine we're almost a level 10 dude could this kite get us there please oh man dude I think one more fish or a crab okay let's be smart about this let's not get attacked by a giant shark again okay I'm taking a 360 view it looks like we're good oh we got this up here could this do it oh man we're so close guys this has got to be it it's a green crab guys I think we can do it I hear fish swimming around but I don't think yes we did it achievement unlocked king crab grow up to level 10 we did it guys that was really really tough oh my good oh now we're getting attacked we're getting attacked mighty Otaka of course of course now they're all coming okay so let's see if I could take him out see if I can think about I took one of them out all the other ones running away oh he's coming back dude we're pretty tough now look at that bite mark he took out of me man that was challenging okay I actually wanted to keep going but looks like we're maxed out at level 10 so guys let's do it let's become they king crab so how do we do this is it just a fish select here it is king crab we unlock them health 90 damage two bites beep okay point eight and two point eight to five point eight one point five point five oh ok so it looks like he's 25% faster I don't know for some reason I can do that math right now and his abilities our passive green crab leader whenever you meet a green crab it will join your army oh that's cool crabs in your army will follow you and defend you with their lives that's cool holding sprint will cause every crab in your army to sprint two you can have max 40 crabs in your army okay active crabs spawn spawns a small queue crab when the crab hatches it will join your army please take care of it cause 25 XP cool down 0.5 seconds okay holy crab guys okay I probably I probably overuse that joke okay look we gotta pick him it's nice that it's free too it's really it's really nice that we don't have to use coins I really like that okay guys first time is the king crap Oh what is this do we just spawn right in front of a crab that's amazing okay so we're already pretty huge I think our damage is the same as a regular crab at the beginning hey there's spots of babies who there's our first baby then kidding it is a cute little baby oh look at that cute little baby oh my goodness Wow okay dude look at me look at me and my cute little baby I don't need any more children it's just me and my baby he loves me okay so guys let's do this we're level one so when they say it's 25 XP for every baby hmm oh this is where I die this is great so I'm gonna eat my in my remains oh oh oh don't fall I'm falling okay king crab is so it grabs a little bit clumsy there we go Oh level it up baby level it up all right so we're level 2 let's have another baby have another baby another baby so it actually doesn't use that much that's pretty nice oh man we are creating our own crab army this is awesome okay now where the red crabs I think the red crabs usually hang out here is red crabs versus green crabs oh here's a green crab up here I don't think this is one of mine it's gonna join my army it just joined my army that is awesome okay what's coming in here is that another green one yes join my army yeah just walk in turn around and join me now I dig I think the purple king crab is down that way we are not ready to take him on oh here's a red one here's a red one dude whoa oh my goodness we demolished him okay oh there's the purple Queen Queen crab I get saying I keep saying green crab guys get over here Oh purple king crab dude guys I don't know how big we gotta get but I want to get big enough so I could take that guy out ok so it does present a little challenge oh oh dude that dropped a lot of meat it does present a little challenge because once we're all attacking something my friends kind of just steal the meat so that's a little bit of a bummer so when they're all attacking I'm just gonna hit bright click over and over yes Oh guys dude our crabs are taking on a dragon fish ok I don't know if this is a good idea this is a good test to see how our RVs do it dude I think we got this guy there's tio tacos getting involved to really we're in the middle of a lot of trouble but I think I think we got this I got a lot of help before the the drape is down but oh great this down give me the give me the food man Oh hmm klej is here that's not good oh man dude he's got nothing on us holy crap okay let's lay some more oh baby these guys I think what they say is true there is strength in numbers Oh guys we had two of them to food this is a battle this is definitely gonna get us ready this should get us ready for the big battle with the king crab okay guys we're at level 8 we get tons of babies oh no oh I see a tiger shark guys we gotta get out of here we got to get out of here okay all we got to do is just find that king crab I'm a little bit lost so as long as we can find the king crab I think we could take him okay guys we're level eight we got a lot of babies there's actually a tiger shark on the way okay so let's just start having babies let's just have lots and lots of babies okay I don't know oh there he is dude he's just hovering around the area okay let's just have dozens of babies this should be able to protect us against most enemies yeah that dude he's just hovering I bet he could just swallow up all these babies so easily okay well maybe well maybe we can go around him let's go this way let's have some hurt that's of our babies hopefully this doesn't break my computer we have so many babies let's just go this way hey hopefully all of our guys will stay with us look at all these guys holy crap okay he's usually down here okay we're on a hunt run a hug we got our crew oh wow guys we might be in a little bit of trouble here okay maybe maybe not fish just keep coming in they just keep coming in and we just keep destroying them okay okay man I have no idea where this king crab is oh dude there's a tiger shark okay we gotta get out of here we gotta get out of here I think there's two tiger sharks oh man I gotta protect my children can we take him out oh my goodness dude can we take on a tiger shark this is a good test actually there's another one there too oh man there's another tiger shark let's have some more babies this is it babies while we're eating them dude I think we took him out oh my goodness we took out a tiger shark oh there's another one there's another one have more babies hold dude how is her health our health is looking pretty good actually okay I want this meat oh

up oh my goodness guys we took out two tiger sharks we took out the king crab we're taking everything out oh we got more okay we got more tiger sharks bring it tiger sharks I really wish I could level up more cuz dude with all these crabs we can level up big time new beds scepter is awesome and it's glowing I wish this scepter had some kind of ability or something but be cool if you just use the scepter to like instantly turn fish into meat oh man but guys we did it those really tough actually to get the level that but we did it I love it we got the crown we got the scepter we have a new king crab oh man but guys that's gonna have to do it for today's Part I really hope you enjoyed if you did as always feel free to hit that thumbs up button and subscribe if you haven't already the bells e

to FEMA grow face so guys today we're gonna be playing as the shark and guys I want to get huge I want to get so big something crazy happens I want either my computer to break or my tiger shark to flip out of the water or something either way guys I just want to get as big as possible but I knew I was gonna need a lot of coin so it's doing a little warming up we got pretty big so I figure let's start off with this beep always let's bully some fish around here and also guys I want to talk today about some potential new creatures that are gonna be added in a future update guys I saw something that could indicate some pretty crazy creatures but guys where as level 56 right now we're swallowing everything in sight and okay so I'm playing on a server and when you play on a server there ends up being some pretty big fish right now it's not too bad but dude earlier this there's a catfish that was monstrous dude we get a cup okay let's see how many times how many bites it takes to take out those catfish okay that was pretty quick oh man here he is can I swallow the catfish no I can't swallow him whole yet but guys I don't know I was gonna do this off camera but then I was just thinking let me just show it to you guys where it's level 61 maybe we'll see how big we can get is this Bebo's and then after a little while we'll plays the shark and guys I want to play as the shark because oh look at that huge Bebo's okay he's not a he's not a threat but dude I think you might be bigger than me but guys I wanted to play as the shark because as you may or may not know it's Shark Week on the Discovery Channel I mentioned this Noah in my amazing frog Part I mentioned it in my Hungry Shark world Part it's Shark Week so I just wanted I'd wanted to do as many shark Parts as possible that guy is huge so this is the third shark Part of the week and since it's Saturday it's kind of the last but three shark Parts in one week that's not bad for Shark Week but you guys I'm actually pretty excited oh did I just swallow that oh no I didn't swallow the camp can I do it no I can't swallow the cabbage but guys I'm pretty excited because I really do like playing as a sharp Wow do we go meat all over the place but I do like playing as the shark and I haven't done it in a really long time so I'm kind of excited I gotta say one of the toughest things about getting huge is it does make it it does make it more difficult to maneuver around the level I don't know why but for some reason it's only the B boats that are old man whoa Oh guys do see that that Bebo's is gone he just flew out of the water what happened how did he do that okay I want to see what he did what did he do to just fly out of the water like that oh man oh I think I did it I did it - I did it oh oh maybe maybe I shouldn't have done this uh-oh oh there he is there's my friend this oh there's a bunch of them up here want we got one two three P bows up here oh there's another one why do we keep going up here mmm what is happening what is happening right now this is the game for a little bit let's see if any more jump up here we have one two three other Bebo's up here we're not in the water we're just we're just running around with these other Bebo's oh there's a crab over there hey see if you can eat that crab you can't eat that crab oh we oh I think he got it actually guys it's kind of funny I don't know if you can see it but there's actually bubble effects which kind of makes no sense there shouldn't be bubbles above ground dude this guy's making a run for it he's I think he's gonna make it oh wait a minute I might make it - okay if I lean him I'll a bomb if I lean forward I think I can crawl oh wow oh wow I can do flips I can do flips now I have complete control dude I can make it back in I know I can make you pick in it okay okay yeah do a little of this do a little backflip dude we got this okay so I got to do is just roll okay I take it back the rolling isn't doing anything we're still in the same spot okay we gave it a go I just ate that crab guys we gave it a good run we made it out I guess I kind of wanted to get here anyway but we've made it out of the slop that was a fun crazy way to start okay guys let's do this let's become a shark let's get huge and guys I want to show you something pretty interesting so in a previous Part I was showing you guys some of these settings and it shows you some information if you hover over the question mark it says it spawns BOTS allow herbivores allow herbivore play spawn bosses so look at this enables bosses BOTS bosses such as the giant shark which we know about the giant octopus the giant crab and the giant mosquito will spawn this requires bonds to be enabled so guys we have BOTS enabled but I don't think this is available I think this is hinting at new creatures that are coming in a new update so guys I am super excited I don't think these are in the game yet but dude I really think they're on the way in a future update that'd be amazing a giant mosquito crazy ok guys so like I said it's Shark Week we're gonna be a shark I really wish I could be the giant shark to great white we're gonna - so it takes 50 coins we have 1,300 this is good this is good now guys here's the thing here's the thing and one of the reason updates they made it to where if you're a bigger fish it takes more experience to level up if you're smaller fish it takes less experience so it might take a little longer to level up okay dude okay don't steal yeah so I don't know it's fun having a friend tag along with us but hopefully doesn't see all my food I've missed playing as the shark I can't believe that crab tried to attack me if you'd like to damage always try to get out you can't get out of the water oh man yeah I missed this guy I really do enjoy playing as the tiger shark I don't think I played as this guy since maybe the first Part or something oh we got an octopus dude the crabs are trying to get him you can't get that actor points I know the crabs can jump but he wasn't doing it no don't steal us don't steal this please don't oh please don't steal dude I came to see I think he stole it last you look he's trying to get all the water he's trying to get out of the water to get that guy actually let's test our jumpy ability oh hi can we jump can we jump ok we could jump wow that's pretty good we got some hops baby okay this is nice there's actually some pretty big crabs so guys what's gonna be our biggest threat definitely the the great white shark is gonna be our biggest threat oh boy I think we'll be able to take on a brow rag pretty quickly the pack do the peg eaters like the Raptors the T attack does those flows okay you gonna steal my food I'll steal yours okay bring it up just need you to break it up for me yeah stomp the back eaters like the T attack and the Raptors those even the Bebo's those could be a little trouble oh my goodness dude was that a goldfish look at our suck radius I think I patented that that phrase last time but our suck radius is pretty good we can suck in everything from a pretty big radius so guys we're actually already a level 11 level 12 dude we are oh look at this guy oh he's huge it's a huge crab but we're off to a pretty good start here I think we're gonna be able to get pretty big pretty fast and that's the goal and guys I'm playing on hard I'm playing hard and I'm playing on a server so we will get experience a little faster but it will be a little more challenging so I usually look for hot spots I feel like this area down here it's usually a pretty good hot spot you'll have a lot of small fish will have some crabs every once a while brown rag will show up or another big fish but right now the coast is pretty clear oh man look at that guy dude that's a pretty big I think those are called nil ins or something that's a pretty big one definitely bigger than normal dude he could probably do it dese amount of damage let's get him 23 okay so we're doing 23 damage we have 235 hell guys I dude I honestly think we'd take out a brow right pretty soon I forget how much forget how much damage the brow reg does and I gotta say it's nice seeing another tiger shark oh dude oh yeah break that up kit I was trying to steal a problem it's nice seeing another tiger shark and not having to worry about it actually that K looks bigger than me stop that alright it's time for a clutch attack baby I do want to get huge as the clutch at some point I don't think I don't know if I've ever used that guy oh no great white are you kidding me dude I had no idea no idea I was just snacking on some zebras okay okay dude we're at level 20 okay you stay away you plastic great white I can't believe okay you got to be more careful okay guys I see the great white over there let's just go to the other side I usually go to the left let's change up our route a little bit I usually go to left let's hang out with these Bebo's none of us they could be getting pretty big their pack hunters so there's still kind of a threat so we got to be careful we're back up to level 23 oh no oh no we got Raptors okay okay we got a lot of raptors I think we're I think we're taking a lot of them out okay we just leveled up this is good okay they're taking a little bit of damage I think we're I think we're good as long as I can as long as I can get away from these guys okay okay got away from them let's let's eat them up they didn't take too much we're still at 250 we're good okay there's a brow rag okay we gotta you got to be careful guys this is it's really kind of uncharted territory I don't hang out here much except when I get really huge kind of take up the whole ocean oh man look at the great way okay great white I think he's getting big even for a great white we gotta just stay on the opposite side of the map that guy oh my goodness dude look at this free piece of meat just hanging out nobody wants this okay I'll take it all right let's hang out with the Tres a little bit I like taking these guys out it was fun being a drave last time I don't know why but they just remind me of Dragon so I call him the dragon fish but dude wouldn't it be amazing if take a breathe fire I know that kind of doesn't make any sense cuz their underwater footage of that Oh fish they could breathe fire it would just be extinguished immediately okay okay I see some pretty big fish dude that is a huge Raptor over there we got a we got a level up a little more to be able to take him out okay another free piece of meat got it do people just leaving their left horse yeah that Raptor is monstrous I don't think we could take him out yeah okay guys now is the time let's see if we could take out a brow rag I think we oh yeah we dude we are monstrous yeah we're monstrous if sometimes it's hard to tell how big we really are compared to these other guys especially now that they can level up dude we're level 38 we can take out a brown rag easy all right the great whites over there dude we just gotta watch out for that guy as long as we're clear the great way I were gonna be safe for a while I think his base damage is around like 80 something so I got to make sure dude we are cleaning up dude oh my goodness it's like a vacuum it's like we're vacuuming the bottom of the whoo ocean yeah this actually gives you some pretty decent XP okay well I gotta remember this Oh what's biting me what's biting me oh it's Bebo's is Bevo's okay nothing to worry about here nothing to worry about here I don't think um I don't think oh man dude actually kind of kind of something to worry about okay I can't see him am i taking damage I'm not taking damage anymore they actually took there's a lot of people if they actually took a decent on a damage rent like 370 yeah I think my health was a lot better than that before and swimming all weird okay dude that's a big drave you feel like I'm swimming weird I feel like I'm wounded or something oh look at that rafter dude oh no oh no stay away from that Raptor is he going after me No dude honestly I think we are close to being able to take that guy oh man great white is really close must must get away from great white okay dude let's hang out with our buddies if the great white attacks maybe our buddies would help us okay we're actually starting get pretty huge let's see what our damage is that wow it's red 94 dude we got this guy we got this great white let's take him out right now um I think we're 450 for 450 for hell we can take this guy out right oh man this is probably not a good idea oh he's doing 149 damage oh we're dead we're dead it's over over realize no biggie actually was flashed dude I'm pretty sure their base damage is like 80 something he was doing almost 150 damage and I was doing in the 90s okay guys we're level 72 we're doing 181 damage we're taking out brow rags pretty quick our health is only at 620 so I think we could take out this great white guys it's just depends on how much health he has dude let's just go for it he actually does look like he's pretty big so he might even be stronger than last time dude look at those Bebo's okay oh my goodness he's is he going for him no dude I think that always going for him holy crap I think the Bebo's is bigger than the great white he's taking on two of them oh my goodness is this B oh it's coming towards me I just can't that just came to say the fight oh my goodness okay this is actually not good so I think he just got bigger he just got bigger okay he's oh he's he's behind okay he's okay here we go here we go he's gonna say he's worried about the other guy oh please yes we got a baby okay he actually took a lot of my health away you only have to 95 laughs I we took him how baby okay so we are at level 77 that's not bad and we are kind of hurting did he take out both of those Bebo still those guys were huge I felt like that was gonna be our biggest competition I think we're the biggest thing in the ocean now oh no we got this guy still guys do you think we could take him out let's go for it this might be the end guys this might be yet we're doing 202 damage he's not even hitting us dude this guy is huge this should give us a lot of meat oh man holy crap we're level 80 okay guys let's do it again we're doing 267 damage that's what I'm talking about he didn't even hit us we level 93 we're gonna be in triple digits in no time okay guys we just hit level a hundred man I don't know I don't know how much bigger I can get it already seems like it's glitching out quite a bit dude we just can't we just gotta keep taking out this great white oh man look at that zebra dude this guy got pretty big I'm impressed dude I really like the zebra it's fun to see that one of them got pretty big I feel bad for eating him immediately all right here's the question can we swallow the great white hole yet no no we can't swallow them all dude that was actually a really good maneuver yeah here we go guys here we go get him yes we smell them all baby guys red 134 it's glitching like crazy dude I don't know how much more we can do all right guys one more great white yeah we're at level 150 I feel like this is good wrong number good number two stop it it's glitching like crazy as you can see guys let's see let's see if we can glitch things out a little bit so here's my idea for some reason when we were the Bebo's if we were just if we just kept swimming up against a wall we ended up just flying out of the map let's see if that works here okay I'm going I'm going into this wall oh man guys we're doing it what we're doing it oh oh here we go baby you were were kind of we're outside the map we're not flying yet okay I kind of wanted to do the thing where we're flying we are so glitched oh man can I like can I fall out of the man okay so here's land oh there we go okay we are up on the land oh boy oh we're flying we're flying now oh dude oh man oh my goodness now we're flying we are so high above as we are airborne oh my goodness dude this is the highest we've had okay we're dead oh my goodness I don't know why I love that so much it's just fun glitching out of the map okay we're dead well guys that's going to do it for today's Part this was so much fun yeah guys I had to play as the shark it was Shark Week so we just had to and also I'm super excited for this like giant octopus John mosquito if they're gonna add these I feel like they wouldn't have said it if they're not gonna add it but who knows but guys I really hope you enjoyed the Part if you did as always feel free to hit that thumbs up button and subscribe if you haven't already and I will see you guys in the next feed and grow fish she's stand here and see what happens
