dude the tea tacos are attacking no no no saben going up against a great white oh who he almost got me dude anyone's up guys welcome back to fish feed and grow remember last video how I said I love this game well I love it anymore I don't know what it is about this game the more I play it the more I love it and I'm just so glad that you guys love it too so guys you hit the like button almost two thousand times on each of our first videos which is crazy it just makes me happy that I love this game you guys love it too but you got to be careful you keep it in that like button I might keep playing this game so guys we played the river we played the ocean today we're gonna do the beta map and we're gonna do deathmatch unlimited the only difference between these two game modes is that with deathmatch you're limited to level 10 you can't go past level 10 I'm planning on going past level 10 so we'll do deathmatch unlimited we'll do normal because like I said last video they just recently added hard and apparently normal was the old hard so I think I want to play the game a little bit more this is only our third video so I want to play the game a little bit more before we bump it up to hard so here we go we're gonna play the beta map and guys I got something to tell you I have 550 coins I got 500 50 coins let's played a little bit before the video and I got carried away um so let me show you let me show you exactly how I got 550 coins and I leveled up pretty high so I have plenty of coins I can play any of these characters but we're gonna start off with the by bows cuz I'm gonna show you guys how I did this okay so there's a strategy there's a strategy to this and I found this out when I was streaming I was streaming this game a little bit this past Wednesday and I'm just playing for fun and stuff and then all of a sudden I was like what is happening here I found like this okay we're a little bit uh you still got to be careful I found this area okay we're in a dangerous area but I found a way to level up pretty fast so uh basically what I did is I just started there we go he leveled up right there I just started snacking on these little pink things a little bit of this never hurts a little me okay yeah I just snack on these pink things and whoo-hoo watch out for that guy and depending on the area you can find a lot of these pink things okay be careful but then hmm watch out then I moved on to these little ooh that guy's dead - the little purple guys where's the purple guys okay here they are I like to call these guys bug-eyed McGee look at those cute bug eyes so I just work on these guys for a little bit we're already at level three okay you just work on these guys a little bit you can level up pretty fast they're kind of hard to catch once you get um they're dead get over here bug eyes McGee oh they're so cute these out of all the fish these might be the cutest most of all most of what all they are is just eyeballs and so I left love with these guys I get to maybe level four maybe level five and then I move on to the Jackpine spot okay so now that I'm at level five it's time to move on to the jackpot spot so here it is now the thing about the jackpot I like to call is the jackpot spot think about the jackpot spot is a lot of the other fish knows the jackpots by two um so it could get dangerous but right now dude if you're clear if there's no I think they're called like pleasure sub that there's no pledge right they you're good to go mad so you just you just hang out here you chomp a bunch of these fish and you level up and it's beautiful because there's no other fish like stealing your meat and these fish don't even eat it I don't know why like every fish if there's meat laying around they all grab it but these fish they don't grab the meat they just sit here they're not hostile it's like it's a jackpot spot but the thing is they just keep spawning in it just keeps spawning it there's no hostile fish around these just keep spawning in that you'll never run out and you just are chomping okay so now we're at level 11 at this point you don't even have to aim for the fish you just start chopping and they just run into you just hitting the left click button I'm just hitting left like now I'm just moving around so I'm just facing them and you just keep chomping and then you end up breaking the meet up and I found out I'm pretty sure if you break up the meet you end up getting more XP so you just keep chopping the fish we're getting a lot of meat here dude holy yeah and then you just suck it all up we went from 11 to 12 to 13 now we're at 14 it's just the fastest way I've ever seen to get coins to level up and I know it's kind of like an exploit kind of thing because they just keep respawn but if you want to just get some quick coins you want to just level up really quick it's the fastest way to do it dude we're level 16 already and then eventually just get big enough to where you can just suck up the fish automatically I'm just holding right-click they keep spawning I just select them in the thing is though you get plenty of coins this way with every fish that you just in golf but you get more point to get more points to level up if you chop up the meat like this okay holy camp we're level 24 this is crazy okay okay so I just had to show you guys I just had to show you something I found out and that's how I ended up with so many coins hey I wonder where little 20 40 think when you take on a catfish let's go for let's go for the campus okay we're doing 38 damage he's doing 21 damage we got this guy catfish is dead baby oh holy crap okay let's break up the meat hopefully no other fish come and break and steal army holy crap holy crap that's a lot that's a lot of meat okay so let's just take it all in holy crap holy crap okay so guys let's switch fish let's do the catfish because last video we were messing with catfish a lot and I never use the catfish so let's switch over to the catfish let's have some fun with him so in the beta map we can use the buy boats or Bevo's whatever you want to call it the Raptor the klej and the catfish catfish is 50 coins huh we only have 863 okay here we go let's have some fun with the catfish so guys I saw in the comments some people are talking about how you say the name of this game some people call it fish feed and grow some people call it theme grow fish it's tough because in steam it's called feed and grow fish but Oh Oh tonight Li is this leftover from me but in the title screen it looks like it has it as fish feed and grow be the way you can call it whatever you want I just love it I just love the game okay let's eat some crab dude I actually love crab legs do you guys like crab legs I know some people aren't like big into seafood I personally really like it I'm like a really picky eater but I really like seafood Oh be out of Bibles or Bebo's he's trying to tag me try to take me down you can't take down a cabbage do the knight whole was the oh that's a Raptor guys I want to be a raptor today I want to be a raptor and I want to get huge okay so we leveled up is the café's we're taking these guys down whole one nice thing about the catfish is you don't really have to get that big you can just swallow these bug I McGee's you can swallow them whole pretty quickly right off the bat we're only level two okay so I won't do the exploit let's look for some let's look for some prey where's that klej oh there's one get him dude he did even see me coming oh we got him dude oh oh Judy's friends are his friends are eating the remains okay dude back off okay dude with some of these fish some of them will they'll like team up against you that's when it gets really dangerous these guys aren't even doing anything they know they're no match okay we got three of them we got three klej so that could be could be dangerous dude I don't know man they're not doing anything it's me my catfish buddy we're just bullying these guys oh okay dude I see a by Bo's I see I see a BIOS and a clutch this could get ugly your the thing is when you're a big fish you're always a risk of getting like teamed up Bob okay dude I see a few Raptors to get him yes it's all about time and baby I see some Raptors now the fact that I attacked one of them it could make some of the other ones come around dude I don't know man I think we're pretty safe I feel like of all the maps I think the beta map oh here we go we got by boat okay we got a pack of I bows and they're going to get the rafter okay no don't die here don't die here okay don't die here okay cuz I was just about to say I think of all the vamps I feel like the beta map might be the easiest it's not too big there aren't really a lot of predators you just got like four different fish so I feel like it's the easiest okay we got we have five Bibles okay we got five votes I want to take them out I want to take about can I take these guys out dude okay my health is at 194 183 mmm okay so what I what I try to do is just spring out of this when they're doing that oh man 136 dude Oh baby I love how I just said this is the easiest of our bout to die okay okay go through here sound good hmm know what Dad hey we're dead what can you do at this point I can't turn around to get these guys okay dude a Pecha by Bose that's a tough one all right all right well that's enough of a beta map let's go dude let's go to the ocean how I I've never killed a great white shark I don't know today's the day I'm gonna try so we're gonna do normal we're gonna do deathmatch unlimited cuz I gotta get like I don't know what level I gotta be but I gotta be a high level to take out that great white okay so guys like I said I want to be a raptor and I want to make it huge there's also the tio taka the nil and the drew eel The Clash the trade the tiger shark the brow rag I'm gonna be all of these eventually but today I don't know why I'm feeling like the Raptor I feel like he just looks so cool I feel like he would
 just look amazing if you were huge so his damage is already better than the buy bows and he has this passive ambush so your velocity is converted into boys damnit so the faster you go the more damage you deal which is great cuz I'm always sprinting when I'm attacking so hopefully we do okay and I think I think the ocean is by far the most difficult level you got the brow rag you get the tiger shark you got the great white shark you know there's just so many things that could take you out here we save think we're safe where am I am i oh okay all right now the ocean it's a pretty a pretty big map too okay when I first start out what's going on over there I'm trying to see what's going on from a distance when I first started out I like to pull yes yes this is a good start this is a good start oh okay get out of here I like to go to the crabs I like to have fun with the crabs and I feel like that's a great way to level up at the start here okay these fish are passive we have some other guys okay let's just look for our crab friends hmm okay watch off the dragon it's a we gotta find our crap oho there's a tiger shark we gotta find our crab friends I think a crab friends are over here yeah baby Oh No well that's great white shark no we had the same idea okay okay um great white shark had the same idea is us um let's see if I could grab one of these guys yeah here we go dude first hit with seven damaged that's really good seven damage for the first hit and it wants to just bend cuz I was sprinting towards them okay so are you level two not bad we have to wait for that great white shark to get out of here oh I found a crab I found a stray crab okay this is good start dudes the crabs they're like the easiest they barely even fight back I think sometimes they fight back but for the oh no oh no oh dude I was stuck that was weird that was weird I think I got stuck in the wall or stop them okay you had two crabs touches you're just fun to kill they're also like really funny like it - okay so great whites still here okay I think I think the great white left okay so let's slowly make our way over there we'll grab some of these stray crabs okay are they gonna write again a gang up on me no he's not even open his friend just let me take about okay do we have a lot of crabs here hmm I do have to remember to sprint as I'm going in for the kill because we do a lot of damage when we sprint okay leveled up we're level three baby okay do you see any great white I don't see any great white I think we're safe all right let's see how much damage I do okay nine I think I hit the ground first I want to see how much damage I can do if I get a good sprint a good like running startup to one of these guys Oh 13 Oh so yeah if you get some good velocity Wow 13 damage that's not bad oh I didn't even see that there's an ambush meter okay so it looks like the ambush meter is in direct relation to our speed so yeah once we hit top speed the ambush meters all the way up so that's really cool okay now we're at level six let's see how much damage I do okay eighteen that's pretty good it's not bad okay we have a lot of crabs we got to be careful okay yeah the crabs are actually fighting back now so we got to be a little careful Oh fighting these crabs because they will gang up on me and there's a lot of them down here dude they're like teaming up okay I'm backing off let's sprint and get this guy we're level eight holy crap one chunk twenty-nine damage dude that is really good you ever just wonder what some of these fish are doing like these guys what are you doing like they're swimming around yeah this one around but like what are you trying to accomplish what are you doing you just swimming let's just follow them for a little bit okay so guys just hanging on that corner now they're swimming over here okay now they're swimming into the seaweed yeah they're doing nothing absolutely nothing you know by eating these fish I'm kind of doing them a favor they got nothing else going on you know why not just get eaten by a big old Raptor all right so we're level 10 now I should be able to take on some bigger fish now but what do we want to take on there's no way I could get even close to a brow rag or tiger shark or anything okay I think I see some eel here they take out some eel and dude there's some free food up here okay towards the surface there's some nice things going on up here okay I don't know if the eel traveling packs okay this eel is going straight towards that brow rag what is he doing okay okay he's going straight towards that brow rag I'm not interested in that okay I don't know I was trimming swing straight towards him yeah let's mess with some eel oh they don't seem very smart okay so these are like the dragon fish um I don't think these guys are like pack hunters so if I attack one of them I don't think they're all gonna go after me so let's mess with these guys a little that t/o taka those little blue teo tacos I actually don't want to mess with those they might attack me I don't know I'm level 15 they shouldn't but I don't mind taking these guys the dragon fish oh no okay okay so I did just attack @eo taka Oh No do Tai Chi get off of me get off of me oh man okay the deal doc I'm bad you don't want to mess with those guys and I kind of just picked a fight with them it's not good oh my goodness dude yeah I think this is called the Dre the dragon kind of look at fish okay yeah okay okay I think I could just feed on these guys for a little while I don't know cuz I think these guys keep spawning as well okay yeah we're level 16 dude this might be our new jackpot spot this might be our ocean jackpot spot and the other guys they're not like protecting up it's perfect it's perfect okay chomp this up a little more chomp it up to get more meat yes oh no dude we're in trouble okay dude the tío tacos are attacking no no no no stop it I need some trade to help me okay get out of here oh man dude how do we get out of that okay the tio tags were we got our health back do let's go over here man don't stick it tio taco they don't let up they're dangerous holy crap okay yeah let's let them just hang out there I love these guys I love this with these guys they don't fight back holy cow it's like a war over there with the drape in the tea Oh tacos holy crap it's an absolute war okay let's see how much damage we're doing 78 damage with a sprint holy crap that's a lot of damage okay dude we are sitting pretty as long as we don't get attacked by those tio tacos I think we'll be good okay we are in a little bit of danger there's a tiger shark oh there's two tiger sharks down there no no the tiger sharks no the tiger sharks look a bit okay so hopefully hopefully they don't mess with me over here oh man okay tiger sharks just just stay away keep your distance man always right there I can't believe okay we're almost at level 20 I've never been at level 20 in the ocean hopefully we can do it dude yeah those sharks oh no the sharks are coming in no the Sharks are butting in on my feeding spot okay let's grab some of this free food let's get out of here we're almost at level 20 I just gotta make it out of here safe man okay we just hit level 20 okay this is good oh we got one of these guys I think this is AK ledge he's like hiding in the corner you can't hide man okay I want to check out our jackpot spot again let's see if those tiger sharks are still there man oh my goodness dude okay I don't know I don't see any sharks I think we might be in the clear this is definitely a dangerous oh there's a bunch of tea Oh taco it's definitely a dangerous area why dude if there's not a bunch of dudes a car a bunch of sharks this is a really good way to level up all right guys look at this so if we sprint we're doing 157 damage if we sprint now if I remember correctly I think the great white shark does 84 damage so that's almost double the damage but the thing is the hits after it they aren't 158 you know okay so it looks like 51 is our base damage level 30 we gotta be pretty close being able to take on at least a tiger shark if not the brow rag or a great white okay guys we're level 38 our base damage is 83 I think we could take on some pig so good guys so let's see if I can find a tiger shark let's see if I can find a brow rag and a great white I want to take them all on holy crap Rhett level 40 dude okay give me uh give me a tiger shark I think there was tiger shark hanging around around here somewhere okay there's a brow rag there's the great white dude I don't want to hit I don't want to mess with a great great white yet dude I'm nervous I've never been to level 40 this is awesome I just want to mess it up and I gotta be careful those bibo sortie Oh tiger they could take me out quick okay so I see some tiger sharks oh I couldn't take out multiple tiger sharks okay maybe we're gonna go for the brown rag or we gonna go for a pro wreck I'm gonna do it I'm gonna do it I'm gonna go for a brown rag oh no dude that products messing with five volts no no and dude my health is over five hundred that's crazy okay here's a tiger shark
